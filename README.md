# Computer Vision Projects

This repository showcases a collection of **computer vision tasks** exploring techniques like **segmentation, thresholding, face recognition, and image processing**.  
Each project focuses on a specific algorithm or concept to deepen understanding of how computer vision techniques are applied in practice.

## Projects

1. **[Segmentation and Threshold Techniques](https://github.com/bassantrabie/Segmentor_and_Threshold)**  
   Explores classical and modern segmentation methods including thresholding and clustering-based techniques (Otsu, Optimal, Spectral, K-Means, Region Growing, Mean-Shift, Agglomerative.

2. **[Face Recognition](https://github.com/YourUsername/Thresholding-Project)**  
   Builds a facial recognition system using classical computer vision techniques — including Haar-based detection, PCA for feature extraction, and KNN classification with ROC curve evaluation.

3. **[Hough Transform & Active Contour](https://github.com/YourUsername/Face-Recognition-Project)**  
   Implements Canny, Hough (lines, circles, ellipses), and Active Contour (Snake) methods — built from scratch to detect, analyze, and report object boundaries with detailed shape descriptors.

4. **[Image Processor](https://github.com/YourUsername/Hough-Transform-Project)**  
   A full-featured image processor supporting noise addition, filtering, edge detection, histogram equalization, normalization, thresholding, and Fourier-based frequency filtering.

5. **[Object Detection](https://github.com/YourUsername/Active-Contour-Project)**  
   Implements Harris corner detection, SIFT feature extraction, and SSD/NCC-based feature matching — covering keypoint detection, descriptor generation, and robust correspondence analysis between images.
